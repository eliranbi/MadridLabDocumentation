# MadridLabDocumentation

This repository contains the supporting files for the IBM MobileFirst MadridLab workshop.

* `workbooks/` - The workbooks are maintained in the Markdown language.  Each lab has its own folder within the workbooks/ folder.  Content was developed using the [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) editor.
* `documentation/` - Any additional supporting documentation that would be helpful.  Currently this folder contains a presentation which describes the approach used to manage the source artifacts in Git at [https://github.com/eliranbi/MadridMFPLab]().
* `presentation/` - Future home of the PPT presentation used to introduce the labs.
