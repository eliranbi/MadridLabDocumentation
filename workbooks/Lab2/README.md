# Lab 2 - Use the Cordova CLI to add the MFP v8.0 Cordova Plugin

In this lab, we will use the Cordova CLI to add the MobileFirst Cordova plugin, These will be the typical steps you will need to go through when you want to add plugins to your application, adding the MobileFirst plugin will allow your app to use the MobileFirst platform different features. 
General Steps:

1. Within the Ionic application you will run Cordova CLI command to add the plugin.
2. Use the MobileFirst CLI to preview the application to make sure, the plugin was successfully added. 

##Steps

1. Change context into the MobileFirst project.

        cd IBMEmployeeApp        

2. **Add** the iOS platform, run the following command cordova platform add ios (we didn't check the platform folder to our git-repo so you will need to add it yourself) 

        cordova platform add ios

3. **Run** the cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-mfp ( running this command will add some additional plugins to our project like: cordova-plugin-device, cordova-plugin, globalization	fetch.json, cordova-plugin-dialogs, cordova-plugin-mfp )
