Introduction
============

In this set of labs we will demonstrate how to take an existing Ionic/Cordova
application and add the MobileFirst Platform v8.0 Cordova Plugin, then
demonstrate some of the capabilities provided by MobileFirst. We will cover
bootstrapping, application customization, using MFP 8.0 adapters, MFP 8.0
Operational Analytics, custom report and more.

The activity will start with an Ionic project that we have already created (see
git repo below). The application is an Employee Directory application, named
IBMEmployeeApp

The following exercise includes 11 micro labs (\~20 min each)

-   Lab \# 1 - Understand the Ionic application and learn how to customize it

-   Lab \# 2 - Use Cordova CLI to add the new MFP v8.0 Cordova Plugin

-   Lab \# 3 - Load MFP framework and application Bootstrapping

-   Lab \# 4 - Use MFP CLI to register and manage your application

-   Lab \# 5 - Using MFP adapters frameworks (Server Side)

-   Lab \# 6 - Using MFP adapters frameworks (Client side)

-   Lab \# 7 - Overview MFP Operational Analytics

-   Lab \# 8 - How to capture custom events

-   Lab \# 9 - How to create custom charts and alerts.

-   Lab \# 10 - How to secure your application (Server side)

-   Lab \# 11 - How to secure your application (Client side)  

### Source code for labs

In order to get the latest code for the ionic application, run the following git
command:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 git clone https://github.com/eliranbi/MadridMFPLabAll
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you clone the repo you will notice the following directories :

-   **AdapterServices** - Is a folder that contian our MFP adapter projects, the adapters implement the back-end integration code.

-   **IBMEmployeeApp** - Is our base Ionic Application that we are going to use
    for adding the MFP plugin.

-   **LabDocuments** - Contain the workbooks for his lab.
-   **snippets** - Contain a collection of copy/paste fragments to simplify
making the required source code changes in the labs. They are labeled by lab
name and task, and should be easy to locate and use.the snippets code foe the lab. 
    

In later steps, a **/snippets** folder will be added here, during a git checkout
step. This folder will contain a collection of copy/paste fragments to simplify
making the required source code changes in the labs. They are labeled by lab
name and task, and should be easy to locate and use.

### Tools used in labs

In this lab we will use the following tools :

1.  The MFP Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the MobileFirst
    Plaform, create projects, create adapters, deploy to the mfp server, view
    our mfp console etc.

2.  Your choice of IDE to edit the code. The Brackets IDE was used throughout
    these labs and can be downloaded from here : <http://brackets.io>. Brackets
    is a modern, open source text editor that understands web design. You can
    also use the Brackets Extension manager to install additional plugins for
    code assistant and live preview. The extensions that are used in this
    tutorial are:

    -   ionic-brackets.

    -   Ionic Framework Code Hinting.

    -   Brackets Beautify

### Preview the Ionic app

Lets start with preview our existing Ionic Employee Directory application.

1.  Start Brackets and choose “Open folder” and select the IBMEmployeeApp
    folder.

2.  Use the Brackets file Navigator to locate and click on
    **IBMEmployeeApp/www/index.html**.
    


3.  Click the **lighting** icon in the upper right portion of the Brackets
    window to preview the completed application in the browser.

### Summary

You now have the completed and operational Ionic application in your initial
workspace. In the next lab we will reset our workspace to a known starting point
using 'git checkout'. In later labs you will be able to use 'git checkout' to
get the working project code, in case you get into trouble.
